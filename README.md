# Toolbox
[![Docker Image CI](https://github.com/JackBinary/toolbox/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JackBinary/toolbox/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml)

A collection of small, single‑page utilities focused on being fast, local‑first, and privacy‑preserving. The project is built with a privacy/security‑first mindset: tools are designed to run entirely in the browser so your data stays on your device.

## Tools

- Hash Generator: Create cryptographic hashes from input text. See [hash-generator.html](hash-generator.html).
- Image Compressor: Reduce image size locally with configurable quality settings. See [image-compressor.html](image-compressor.html).
- Line Sorter: Sort and normalize lines of text. See [line-sorter.html](line-sorter.html).
- Passphrase Generator: Generate secure passphrases for accounts and apps. See [passphrase-generator.html](passphrase-generator.html).
- PDF to TIFF: Convert PDF pages to TIFF images locally. See [pdf-to-tiff.html](pdf-to-tiff.html).

## Privacy & Security First

- Local‑first: Processing happens in your browser; no data is uploaded.
- Minimal surface area: Each tool is a focused, single‑purpose page.
- Transparent: Source files are plain HTML and easy to review.
